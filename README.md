# EVVAgent (evva)

A ReAct coding agent in your terminal. Multi-provider LLM, parallel tool dispatch, async sub-agents, swappable UI.

---

## What is EVVAgent?

![evva_logo.png](docs/assets/logo-3.jpg)

`evva` runs a tool-using LLM agent in your terminal. It speaks Anthropic Claude, DeepSeek, GLM (Zhipu/z.ai), OpenAI, and Ollama through one `llm.Client` interface; dispatches multiple tool calls per turn in parallel; tracks tasks and sub-agents through an observable store; and renders into a bubbletea TUI or a plain-text CLI sink.

The architecture is small on purpose — adding a new LLM provider, panel, or UI implementation is roughly one package each.

## Install

macOS, Linux, and Windows (10 1903+) are supported. `go install` and source builds require Go 1.25+; prebuilt binaries for every platform ship with each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/johnny1110/evva/releases).

### Quick install (recommended)

```bash
go install github.com/johnny1110/evva/cmd/evva@latest
```

The binary lands in `$GOBIN` (or `$GOPATH/bin`). Make sure it's on your `PATH`.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnny1110/evva
cd evva
make install
```

Override the location if you want it elsewhere:

```bash
sudo make install PREFIX=/usr/local/bin     # system-wide
make install PREFIX=$HOME/.local/bin        # user-local
```

### Windows

Download `evva-windows-amd64.zip` (or `-arm64`) from the [latest release](https://github.com/johnny1110/evva/releases/latest), unzip `evva.exe` somewhere on your `PATH`, and run it from Windows Terminal — or use `go install` as above (the binary lands in `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin`).

Prerequisites:

- **[Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org)** — the agent's `bash` tool runs through its bundled Git Bash. Without it evva still starts, but shell-backed tools (bash, monitor, hooks) are unavailable and a startup warning says so. Set `EVVA_SHELL` to any other `bash.exe` to override autodetection.
- **Windows Terminal** recommended for the TUI (legacy conhost works on Windows 10 1903+, but rendering is only validated on Windows Terminal).

If SmartScreen flags the downloaded exe, unblock it via file Properties → Unblock — the binaries are unsigned for now. Full details, including what `evva service` does and doesn't do on Windows: [docs/user-guide/en/windows.md](docs/user-guide/en/windows.md).

### Verify

```bash
evva -version
```

Uninstall removes only the binary; your `~/.evva/` config is preserved:

```bash
make uninstall
```

---

## Update

To update evva to the latest version without Go:

```bash
evva update                  # newest stable release (GitHub "Latest")
evva update latest           # same as above
evva update v1.4.3           # pin to an exact stable version
evva update v1.4.3-beta.1    # opt into a specific beta (pre-release)
```

With no argument (or `latest`) this resolves GitHub's Latest release — the newest **stable** build on `main`. Passing a tag pins to that exact build, including a `-beta.N` pre-release or an older version to downgrade. In every case it downloads the pre-built binary for your OS/arch and replaces the current one atomically. No Go toolchain required.

You can also check for updates from inside the TUI with `/update`.

To see your current version:

```bash
evva -version
```

---

## First run

Just type `evva` from any directory. On the first launch evva auto-creates:

```
~/.evva/
├── config/
│   └── evva-config.yml      # user-tunable settings (auto-created with defaults)
└── skills/                  # optional skill scripts (your own)
```

A one-line stderr notice fires the first time only:

```
evva: wrote new config to ~/.evva/config/evva-config.yml — fill in your API keys to use cloud providers.
```

`~/.evva/.env` is **optional**. If you want to override deployment knobs (`LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_DIR`, `APP_ENV`, `LOG_FORMAT`, `SKILLS_DIR`, `USER_PROFILE`), create it; otherwise the built-in defaults apply.

### Adding an API key

Two ways:

1. **From inside the TUI:** type `/config`, navigate to `<provider>.api_key`, press Enter, paste your key, press Enter again. Saved immediately.
2. **By hand:** open `~/.evva/config/evva-config.yml` and fill in `providers.<provider>.api_key`.

Cloud providers (Anthropic, DeepSeek, GLM, OpenAI) need a key; Ollama is local and key-less.

### Swarm & service (multi-agent workstation)

Run a team of collaborating agents with `evva service` + `evva swarm`. A 0→hero
walkthrough — concepts, building a swarm from scratch, the web workstation,
day-2 ops, restart-resume, the full `evva swarm` / `evva service` CLI reference,
and the external-event webhook:

- [English](docs/user-guide/swarm/en.md)
- [正體中文](docs/user-guide/swarm/zh-tw.md)

For a field reference — every manifest field, tool, and coordination pattern —
see the [agent guide](docs/user-guide/agent-guide/).

Or just try a ready-to-run example: the minimal 3-agent
[starter swarm](examples/evva-swarm/starter/) (`evva swarm .`, watch a small team
build a site) or the 7-member [tech-team swarm](examples/evva-swarm/tech-team/).
More live under [`examples/evva-swarm/`](examples/evva-swarm/).

Running it 24/7? `evva service install-unit` wires the host into launchd /
systemd so it survives crashes and reboots —

### Integrate evva in your Go project

Embed evva's agent runtime as a library — custom LLM provider, tools, and event
sink, using only `pkg/*` imports:

- [English](docs/user-guide/en/integration.md)
- [正體中文](docs/user-guide/zh-tw/integration.md)

### LSP integration

Semantic code intelligence — definitions, references, hover, symbols — via the
`lsp_request` tool:

- [English](docs/user-guide/en/lsp.md)
- [正體中文](docs/user-guide/zh-tw/lsp.md)

## Configuration

### `~/.evva/config/evva-config.yml`

User-tunable settings. Created automatically on first launch. Edit live via `/config` in the TUI, or by hand:

```yaml
# Agent loop
max_iterations: 30
max_tokens: 4096
auto_compact_threshold: 0.8
display_thinking: true

# Default model used at startup (overwritten by /model swap)
default_provider: deepseek
default_model: deepseek-v4-pro

# Permission stance at startup. Cycle at runtime with Shift+Tab; -permission-mode CLI flag overrides.
permission_mode: default     # default | accept_edits | plan | bypass

# Web tooling
fetch_max_bytes: 100000
tavily_api_key: ""

# Per-provider credentials. Empty api_url falls back to the constant's default.
# glm = Zhipu AI / z.ai over its Anthropic-compatible endpoint (models glm-4.6, glm-5.2).
providers:
  anthropic: { api_key: "", api_url: "" }
  deepseek:  { api_key: "", api_url: "" }
  openai:    { api_key: "", api_url: "" }
  glm:       { api_key: "", api_url: "" }
  ollama:    { api_url: "" }
```

### `.env` (optional)

Place in your working directory or at `~/.evva/.env`. Only used for deployment / logging knobs — never user preferences:

```bash
APP_ENV=dev            # dev | prod
LOG_LEVEL=info         # debug | info | warn | error
LOG_FORMAT=text        # text | json
LOG_DIR=               # unset → $EVVA_HOME/logs (default); path → custom dir; explicit empty → stdout-only
SKILLS_DIR=skills      # subpath under ~/.evva/
USER_PROFILE=user_profile.md
```

### CLI flags

```bash
evva                                # interactive TUI (when stdout is a TTY)
evva -version                       # print version, commit, and build date
evva update                         # self-update to newest stable (no Go required)
evva update v1.4.3-beta.1           # self-update to a specific tag (stable or beta)
evva -temp 0.7                      # sampling temperature (default unset)
evva -max-tokens 2048               # per-completion output cap (overrides YAML)
evva -max-iters 40                  # loop iteration cap (overrides YAML)
evva -permission-mode=plan          # boot in plan mode (read-only; see "Permission modes")
evva -permission-mode=bypass        # boot with the gate disabled
evva -no-tui "explain loop.go"      # one-shot plain-text mode
echo "list files in /tmp" | evva -no-tui   # piped prompt
```

The full package-by-package breakdown lives in
**[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)** (vision + architecture). Key boundaries:
- `agent` knows about `event.Sink`, never about a concrete UI.
- `pkg/tools/*` and `internal/tools/*` produce `tools.Result` (text + opaque `Metadata`); the UI type-asserts on `Metadata` to render structured payloads.
- `pkg/observable` has no dependencies on agent or UI.
- `pkg/ui` defines two narrow interfaces; implementations live under `internal/ui/` and `pkg/ui/`.

## Roadmap

Much of the original roadmap has shipped: multimodal `read` (images, PDFs,
notebooks), the Veronica multi-agent swarm with a Vue web workstation (`:8888`),
Windows support, MCP client, typed memory, LSP intelligence, and session
persistence. The living roadmap — waves, PRDs, and design docs — lives under
**[docs/roadmap/](docs/roadmap/)**.

### Known limitations
- Sub-agent hierarchy is exactly two layers (no nested spawning).
- Token counts depend on provider reporting — Ollama only reports prompt / eval, not cache or reasoning splits.
- The swarm web workstation binds loopback only and its event webhook is unauthenticated (local integrations only, current phase).
